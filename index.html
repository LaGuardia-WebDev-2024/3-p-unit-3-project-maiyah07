  <p><strong> Ingredients </strong>
  </p>1. Butter 
  <p>2. White sugar 
  <p>3. Brown sugar 
  <p>4. Flour
<p>5. Sea Salt 
<p>6. Chocolate chips 
   <p><strong> Step 1 </strong>
     <p> Start by mixing all dry ingredients, use measuring cup when pouring the flower into your bowl
        <p><strong> Step 2 </strong>
   <p>cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so it’s ready to go when you need it. Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.    
  <p><strong> Step 3 </strong>
    <p>Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.
Use LOTS of chocolate chips. 
  <p><strong> Step 4 </strong>
   <p> Once the cookie dough is finished it is best to use a cookie scoop to portion your dough, scoop your dough and evenley place them on a baking sheet about 2 inches apart from eachother and bake at 375 degrees for about 8-10 miutes

     <ul>
     <li>Time: 50 minutes</li>
   <li>Serves: 10</li>
   <p><strong> Ingredients </strong>
  </p>1. Eggs+water 
  <p>2. Powdered sugar 
  <p>3. Unsweetened cocoa powder 
  <p>4. Oil
<p>5. Vanilla extract 
<p><strong> Step 1 </strong>
  <p>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.
       <p><strong> Step 2 </strong>
  </p>Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!
   Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.

4.<p><strong> Step 3 </strong>
  <p> Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.

 <ul>
    
            <li>Time: 50 minutes</li>
       <li> serves: 10 </li>
      <p><strong> Ingredients </strong>
        <p><strong> Step 1 </strong>
          <p> Beat the eggs with sugar for a whole 7 minutes until thick and glossy, it changes from yellow to white, and tripled in volume 
             <p><strong> Step 2 </strong>
         </p> Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.
 
         <p><strong> Step 3</strong>
           <p>
             
         </p> Gradually add the flour mixture into the egg mixture in 3 lots, mixing for just 5 seconds on Speed 1 in between. This should make the flour just incorporated 
      <p>
        <p><strong> Step 4</strong>
         </p>   use a microwave or stove to heat milk with the butter until it melts. HOT milk helps with rise for these cupcakes
     <p><strong>step 5</strong>

           <strong>Step 6</strong>
         </p> Fill cupcake liners with batter, do not overflow.
         <p>
           <strong>Step 7</strong>
         </p>Bake 22 minutes until golden and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.

 Remove after 2 minutes, Rest for just 2 minutes to let them cool slightly, then get them out of the muffin tin asap
